# Tutorial

This tutorial is intended to introduce you to the CodeDmx framework and the basic principles of MVC architecture. It will show you how a basic CodeDmx application is constructed in step-by-step fashion.

In this tutorial, you will be creating a basic news application. You will begin by writing the code that can load static pages. Next, you will create a news section that reads news items from a database. Finally, youâ€™ll add a form to create news items in the database.
